  conversation:
  - "Oh, well. What\u2019s there to say..."
  - "I\u2019m Gemini. I run the\u2013 uh, <i>this</i> art shop."
  - "I also take commissions, or at least I usually do. I\u2019ve been a little swamped
    lately."
  - "All my time\u2019s been spent on a sculpture for the mayor. A \u2018to scale\u2019
    rendition, and he\u2019s been rather diff\u2013 uh, <i>pedantic</i>, about it."
  - "He wanted to make sure it was truly \u2018reflective of his image\u2019 after
    the work he\u2019d had done."
  - "...Oh dear, don\u2019t tell him I said that."
  - Anyway, I only just got it in the kiln last night.
  - "I was supposed to deliver it to his office this morning, before\u2014 you know,
    all of... <i>this</i>."
  - "I can\u2019t complain though when he\u2019s the one who actually set me up with
    the kiln. Uh, <i>new</i> kiln, that is."
  - The old one was, well, <i>old</i>, and there were problems with using the gas.
