  conversation:
  - "...It\u2019s exciting? <i>I guess</i>?"
  - "I mean maybe I\u2019ll feel bad when I find out who it is, but since we don\u2019t
    know, then it still feels kinda... <i>distant</i>? You know?"
  - "Like it might as well have happened in some other part of the world, and I just
    heard it over the news. Like \u2018Wow, some guy got roasted on power lines in
    China or whatever, sick\u2019."
  - "Like I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s <i>funny</i>, because that would be fucked
    up, and I don\u2019t wanna go to hell or whatever."
  - ...
  - But yeah.
