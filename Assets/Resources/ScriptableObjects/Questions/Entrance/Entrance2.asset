  - "Wh\u2014what\u2019s that now? Murder? Last night? What are you on about?"
  - "I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got no right reason to go thinking there's been a-
    a murder of all things, here in our little town of Aberdeen!"
  - "What? A \u2014 a call? Well that... that hardly proves a thing now does it?"

    And I\u2019m not some- some anonymous, lying nobody."
