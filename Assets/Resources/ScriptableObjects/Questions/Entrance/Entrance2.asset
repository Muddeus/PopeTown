  questionText: "I\u2019m here to investigate the murder from last night"
  conversation:
  - "Wh\u2014what\u2019s that now? Murder? Last night? What are you on about?"
  - "I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got no right reason to go thinking there's been a-
    a murder of all things, here in our little town of Aberdeen!"
  - "What? A \u2014 a call? Well that... that hardly proves a thing now does it?"
  - "Listen, I know what I\u2019m talking about, because I actually live here, right?
    And I\u2019m not some- some anonymous, lying nobody."
  - "And you don\u2019t have any just reason to think I\u2019m lying, now do you?
    I\u2019ve got nothing to hide! I\u2019m just here, doing my job."
  - '[MASK SHATTERS]'
  - "That\u2019s... it\u2019s..."
  - "Look, it\u2019s a warm Autumn is all, and..."
  - "...oh, alright then. Yes. There\u2019s been some... some foul play. Mayor Bunyon
    told me to be wary of people poking around."
  - Some sorry sod got tossed from the mayor's balcony and got fried on the power
    lines.
  - Can't even tell who they are anymore. Or, well, were.
  - "So just... head on through to the Mayor's Office by the Town Square. He\u2019ll
    fill you in."
  - "Tell him you... snuck past? Maybe? I don\u2019t know, I guess that\u2019s not
    much better."
