  questionText: "I\u2019m here to investigate the murder from last night"
  conversation:
  - "Wh\u2014what\u2019s that now? Murder? <i>Last night</i>? What are you on about?"
  - "I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve got no right reason to go thinking there's been a-
    a <i>murder</i> of all things, here in our little town of Aberdeen!"
  - "What? A \u2014 a <i>call</i>? An <i>anonymous</i> call? Well that hardly proves
    anything, now does it?"
  - "Listen, I know what I\u2019m talking about, because I actually <i>live</i> here!"
  - "And you don\u2019t have any just reason to think I\u2019m lying, now do you?
    I\u2019ve got nothing to hide! I\u2019m just here, doing my job..."
  - '[MASK SHATTERS]'
  - "That\u2019s... it\u2019s..."
  - "<i>Look</i>, it\u2019s a warm Autumn is all, and..."
  - "...oh, <i>alright</i> then. <i>Yes</i>. There\u2019s been some... some <i>foul
    play</i>. Mayor Bunyon told me to be wary of people poking around."
  - Some sorry sod got tossed from the mayor's balcony and got fried on the power
    lines.
  - Can't even tell who they are anymore. Or, well, <i>were</i>.
  - "So just... head on through to the Mayor's Office by the Town Square. He\u2019ll
    fill you in."
  - "Tell him you... <i>snuck past</i>? <i>Maybe</i>? I don\u2019t know, I guess
    that\u2019s not much better."
