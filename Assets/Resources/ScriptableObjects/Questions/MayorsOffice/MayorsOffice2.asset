  conversation:
  - "Some sorry sap \u2014or sapette, or what have you\u2014 flung themselves from
    my balcony and onto the live-wires sometime last night."
  - Put the power out too. Lost a good half-tub of rocky road.
  - "The body was spotted at... when was it\u2014"
  - "5. Yeah, 5am this morning. Spotted by a \u2018Lady of the night\u2019 as she
    was passing by."
  - Scream woke the whole damn town.
  - "I\u2019d been burning the midnight oil and had taken a nap in the rec room downstairs,
    so I was the first one out after her."
  - "Didn\u2019t hear anyone going in or out."
