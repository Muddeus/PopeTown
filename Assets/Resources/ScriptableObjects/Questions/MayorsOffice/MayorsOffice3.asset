  questionText: Why is the body still up?
  conversation:
  - "Yes. Why is the body still up? I\u2019d just love to know that as well."
  - "See, we\u2019d have had them down by now, yet somehow the power managed to spring
    back on five minutes after the body was first sighted."
  - "The one person responsible for it all, this local handywoman of ours, she\u2019s
    saying that turning it off again is a \u2018matter more complicated than it seems\u2019.
    Somehow."
  - Hence why the power is yet to be turned off. Hence why a rotten, roasted corpse
    can still be seen from my window.
  - "If the smell ends up sticking around I\u2019ll have to swap buildings."
  - "Oh! I know. Morris down at the Butcher\u2019s is behind on utilities. I\u2019ll
    just swap us \u2018round and call it even."
  - "He won\u2019t mind the smell either."
