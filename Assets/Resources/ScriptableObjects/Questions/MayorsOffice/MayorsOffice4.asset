  questionText: Do you think anyone might be looking to frame you?
  conversation:
  - Broadly speaking? Many.
  - "See, most people who end up in my position, they\u2019re either weasels or pencil
    pushers."
  - But me?
  - "I\u2019m the entire suite."
  - "I\u2019m the jock on the Chess Club."
  - The nerd on the Balls Club.
  - "The people want to be me, be with me, or be in me. And if they can\u2019t be
    any one of those things, then they want to be rid of me."
  - To go so far as to frame me for murder though..? Not so sure.
  - "Only one who\u2019s had my number lately is this old coot, Fishburn. Local bum.
    Been mad about the new development I\u2019ve got going on in the East District."
  - "Real nerve on the guy, getting uppity about new houses when he can\u2019t even
    be bothered to get his own."
