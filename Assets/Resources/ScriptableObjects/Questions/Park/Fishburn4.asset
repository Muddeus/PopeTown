  questionText: What were you doing last night?
  conversation:
  - I was up to my usual. <i>Stargazing.</i>
  - "See, I\u2019m homeless by choice. Why on Earth would I choose to live life with
    a constant barrier between me and nature\u2019s greatest beauty?"
  - After all, you get some of the best night skies out here in Aberdeen.
  - Or at least, you <i>used</i> to.
