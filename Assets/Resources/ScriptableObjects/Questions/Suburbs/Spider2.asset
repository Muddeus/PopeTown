  conversation:
  - "Well, I\u2019m the one who found the body, which I\u2019m assuming is the reason
    you\u2019re talking to me."
  - "That or you think I might\u2019ve been the one that did it."
  - "<i>Ooo</i>, that\u2019s exciting."
  - "I was obviously shocked when I found it, but in the big picture, it\u2019s not
    particularly unexpected. At least not for what Aberdeen\u2019s becoming."
  - "Bunyon\u2019s being really lax with his whole \u2018East Development Project\u2019.
    Not enough\u2019s being put into keeping the expanding neighbourhood safe."
  - "So the East District\u2019s getting dangerous, and it\u2019s only a hop and
    a skip away from the heart of Aberdeen."
