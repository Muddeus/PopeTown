  questionText: Do you feel safe here?
  conversation:
  - Well, I used to feel <i>safer.</i>
  - "And I\u2019m not referring to the murder. Although that obviously hasn\u2019t
    helped."
  - No, some asswipe ass-swiped my <i>gun.</i>
  - "That or I dropped it. Either way, now there\u2019s some asshole running around
    with my Colt Delta Elite and I\u2019m stuck with bear mace."
  - And yeah, <i>sure</i>, there are plenty of street corners in the safer parts
    of Aberdeen, but not as much action either.
  - "So if you\u2019re gonna be poking around anyway, mind keeping an eye out for
    my gun?"
