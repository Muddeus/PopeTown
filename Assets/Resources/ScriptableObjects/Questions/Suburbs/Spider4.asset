  questionText: What do you think of the East District development?
  conversation:
  - "Well on paper it\u2019s good, but so\u2019s half the stuff Bunyon promises,
    and that\u2019s where most of it stays."
  - "We still don\u2019t have a physician, but you know what we have <i>two of</i>

  - Squash courts.
  - "And I don\u2019t mean he expanded the one court into <i>two</i>. We now have

  - "So after the mayor set him up there, that put me at ease a little. So there\u2019s
    that at least."
