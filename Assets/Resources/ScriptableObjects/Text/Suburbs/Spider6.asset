  questionText: What were you doing in the Town Square when you found the body?
  conversation:
  - ...
  - I like you hun.
  - "I can tell the way a person judges me the moment they first look at me. And
    you look at me like I\u2019m just the baker, or the postman. Just another person
    doing their job."
  - A part of that job, is <i>confidentiality.</i>
  - "I\u2019m not hiding any of my own secrets."
  - "But I\u2019m still hiding <i>plenty of secrets.</i>"
  - I know someone who likes to stick things in mousetraps.
  - I know someone who likes to be stoned. The biblical kind.
  - "And I bet you\u2019ve never even heard of gum-play."
  - "And I\u2019ll tell you all about it. Just stick around for my deathbed."
  - "For now, all I\u2019ll tell you for your investigation is this:"
  - "I only leave the East District if I\u2019m called."
